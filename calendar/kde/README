Follow the steps given below to build the code.

1. Build KDE 4 from source
	- use kdesvn-build from http://kdesvn-build.kde.org/
	- build only kdelibs and kdebase
	- take qt from your distro (if older build qt-copy as well)
2. Sync files from smc git to kde source tree
	- rsync -av --progress  <path-to-smc-git>/calendar/kde/* <path-to-kdesvn-tree>
3. Run tests
	- go to <path-to-kdesvn-tree>/build/kdelibs
	- make kcalendartest
	- run kdecore/tests/kcalendartest
	- kdecore/tests/kcalendartest -functions (for listing available tests)
	- kdecore/tests/kcalendartest testName -v2 (for running named test with detailed output)
